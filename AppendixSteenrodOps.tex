\subsection{Cup products in Ext}
\label{sec:ExtStructure}

The $Ext$ functos have quite a bit of structure, which we will explore in this section.  

Fix some field $k$. 
Let $A$ be a $k$-algebra and $X$,$Y$ and $Z$ be $A$-modules.
Then there is a product, which we will call the cup product, 
\[Ext_A(X,Z)\otimes Ext_A(Y,Z)\to Ext_{A\otimes A}(X\otimes Y,Z)\]

Formally, the computation of this product will be very similar to cup products in topological cohomology.  
To construct the product, let $K$ be an  $A$-resolution of $X$ and $L$ be an  $A$-resolution of $Y$.  
Then $K\otimes L$ is an $A\otimes A$-resolution of $X\otimes Y$.  
If $[x],[y]$ are cocycles in $Ext_A(X,Z)$ and $Ext_A(Y,Z)$ respectively, define

THIS NEEDS TO BE WORKED-OUT/FINISHED


\subsection{Chain Level Construction of Steenrod Operations}
\label{sec:SteenrodConstruction}

\begin{Theorem}
  Let $A$ be a cocommutative $\F_2$-Hopf Algebra, and $M$ a module over $A$.  
  Then there is a map of graded modules
  \[\A\otimes Ext_A(\F_2,M)\to Ext_A(\F_2,M)\]
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $K$ be a projective resolution of $\F_2$.
  We can view $K\otimes K$ as an $A$-module via the Hopf-comultiplication $A\to A\otimes A$.  
  We have an $\A$-map 
  \[\Delta_0:K\to K\otimes K\]
  lifting the identity $\F_2\cong \F_2\otimes \F_2$, and this is good for computing cup products. 
  Let $\rho$ be the switching endomorphism on $K\otimes K$.  
  We have
  \[\rho\Delta_0 : K\to K\otimes K\]
  is another such map.  
  Because $K$ has a contracting homotopy, we can compute $\Delta_1$ which satisfies
  \[\Delta_1\partial + \partial\Delta_1 = \rho\Delta_0+\Delta_0\]
  Likewise, $\Delta_1$ and $\rho\Delta_1$ are homotopic, and so on, so we can find chain of degree $n$
  \[\Delta_n :K\to K\otimes K\]
  \[\Delta_n\partial + \partial\Delta_n = \rho\Delta_{n-1}+\Delta_{n-1}\]
  Letting $\sigma$ be our contracting homotopy, we can write an explicit recursive formula
  \[\Delta_n = \sigma(\partial\Delta_n + \rho\Delta_{n-1}+\Delta_{n-1})\]
  
  Finally, define for $[u]\in Ext_A^{s,t-s}(\F_2,M)$
  \[Sq^i(u)(\sigma) = (u\otimes u)(\Delta_{2s-i}\sigma)\]

  Now we just need to show that these operations obey the Adem relationship, that is, that this is actually an action of the Steenrod Algebra.  TODO

  \end{proof}

This gives a finite time algorithm for computing the Steenrod action on Ext, but it has a major flaw.  The issue is that $\Delta_i$ encodes information about every possibile decomposition of chains, and these compositions live in $K\otimes K$.  
Recall that the grating on $K$ is given
\[K_i=\bigoplus_{j+k=i} K_j\otimes K_k\]
Thus, roughly speaking, $K\otimes K$ is about the size of $K$ cubed in each degree.  
In our case, $K$ is already bigraded and gets pretty large for large internal degrees, making $K\otimes K$ more-or-less impossible to compute with. 

However, there is hope, due to Nassau.  
A cocycle in $x\in Ext^s$ can be represented by a long exact sequence $\mathcal{X}$ given
\[M\to M_s\to ..\to M_0\to k\]
and a chain map $K\to \mathcal{X}$ with the identity on one side and the cocycle from $K_s\to k$ on the other.  
If $\mathcal{X}$ is small enough, we can consider constructing chain maps
\[\Delta_n : K\to \mathcal{X}\otimes\mathcal{X}\]
as above, and it is easy to see that this computes $Sq^{2s-n}(x)$.  

Of course, $\mathcal{X}$ is not so easy to pick small, since if you use pushouts, as in the proof that you can represent cocycles with extensions, you find that $\mathcal{X}$ is almost as big as $K$.
