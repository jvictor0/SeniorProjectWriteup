\subsection{Chain Level Construction of Steenrod Operations}
\label{sec:SteenrodConstruction}

We now present a homological construction of the Steenrod Operations sufficient for \ref{sec:SteenrodCohom}.  
Let $\Z/2$ be generated by $\rho$.
Let $K$ be an $\F_2$ DGA and $W$ be a free $\F_2[\Z/2]$ resolution of $\F_2$ with one generator, $e_i$, in each dimension and differential $\partial e_i\mapsto (\rho+1)e_{i-1}$.  
Let $\Z/2$ act on $W\otimes K\otimes K$ by
\[\rho(w\otimes x\otimes y)=(\rho w)\otimes y\otimes x\]
Suppose we are given a $\F_2[\Z/2]$-chain map 
\[\Theta : W\otimes K\otimes K\to K\]
with 
\[\Theta(e_0\otimes u\otimes v)=uv\]
Then we can define for $x\in K$ of dimension $n$
\[Sq^i(u)=\Theta(e_{n-i}\otimes u\otimes u)\]

Now, in both cases that we care about, $K=Hom(C,\F_2)$ where $C$ is a free chain complex over a $\F_2$-Hopf Algebra $A$.  
The comultiplication in $A$ makes $C\otimes C$ an $A$-module, and there is a special $A$-map 
\[D_0:C\to C\otimes C\]
such that if $x,y\in Hom(C,\F_2)$
\[(x\smile y)(\sigma)=(x\otimes y)(D_0\sigma)\]
Let $\Z/2$ act on $C\otimes C$ by twisting.  Then $\rho$ is $A$-homotopic to the identity, so there is an $A$-chain map 
\[D_1:C\to C\otimes C\]
such that
\[D_1\partial+\partial D_1 + D_0+\rho D_0=0\]
And likewise for each $j>0$, so define
\[\Theta' : W\otimes C\to C\otimes C\]
by 
\[\Theta'(e_i\otimes x)=D_i(x)\]
One can check this is indeed a chain map, and we can define
\[\Theta(e_i\otimes u\otimes v)(\sigma) = (u\otimes v)(\Theta'(e_i\otimes \sigma))\]
Of course in this case we have,
\[Sq^i(u)(\sigma)=(u\otimes u)(D_{n-i}\sigma)\]
Thus to compute these operations algebraically, one only needs to compute the $D_i$.
