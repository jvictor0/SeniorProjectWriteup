\section{TODO!!!!}



I need to deal with the Steenrod Operations proof, fix up the appendix on Ext, figure out what it is I want to say, get the 8 different products straight.  

Prove Hopf is a map of groups

Add chart for Stable Homotopy Groups of spheres

Mention distingushied triangles of spectra

Generally add more citations

Make it say like ``figure three'' next to important figures so I can reference them later.

Make my diagrams less horribly ugly!!!!  Especially surjection and injection arrow!

Say what a coalgebra and that crap is (TOOO MUUUUCH)
